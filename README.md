sv = semiverbal (not speaking, but will sometimes use emojis or say very few words)

nv = nonverbal (i dont say anything at all)

iwc = interact with care

tc = touch comfort

c+h = cuddles and hide

(tc and c+h always apply no matter what, i only put them in my names because not everyone checks githubs..)

<h5 align='center'

i  like  cuddles  .  .  feel  free  to  cuddle  me  when  you  see  me  :)  i  wont  say  anything  because  im  shy  but  it  makes  me  happy


i will cuddle you if you have c+h in your name! buuuut ill probably only do it one time maximum unless you're alone most of the time cause the second i start seeing more than one person i get nervous :') sorry. i also tend to think people find me annoying


whenever  you  think  i 'm  afk  feel  free  to  whisper


please..  try  to  be  nice  to  me  :(  i  take  a  lot  of  things  to  heart.  i  also  may  misinterpret  what  you  say  so  im  sorryr......


if  im  playing  roblox  feel  free  to  join  from  profile  (my  joins  are  set  to  everyone.)


sometimes  i  make  websites  but  im  really   bad  at  coding


if  i  follow  you  on  here  i  either  wanna  be  friends  or  i  just  rlly  like  your  ponies  please  don 't  think  anything  of  it /srs
